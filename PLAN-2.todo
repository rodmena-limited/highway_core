# Highway Core Migration Plan

## Objective
Convert all YAML workflow definitions to highway_dsl Python workflows, ensure complete compatibility, and update all testing infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Workflow Migration
- [ ] Identify all YAML workflow files in tests/data/
- [ ] Create highway_dsl Python equivalents for each YAML workflow
- [ ] Ensure all workflows execute successfully
- [ ] Test complex workflows with loops, conditions, and parallel execution

## Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure Update
- [ ] Update existing tests to use Python DSL workflows
- [ ] Modify factcheck.sh to work with Python workflows
- [ ] Update any scripts that rely on YAML workflow files
- [ ] Verify CLI compatibility with Python DSL workflows

## Phase 3: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite with new Python workflows
- [ ] Ensure all functionality works as before
- [ ] Rename original YAML files to .yaml.bk extension
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect DSL usage

## Current Status
- ✅ Fixed loop execution issues in engine
- 🔄 Planning complete migration
- 🔄 Next: Execute Phase 1 - Convert YAML workflows to Python DSL

## Key Files to Convert
- tests/data/loop_test_workflow.py (already exists)
- tests/data/while_test_workflow.yaml
- tests/data/complex_workflow_1.yaml
- Other YAML workflow files in tests/data/
